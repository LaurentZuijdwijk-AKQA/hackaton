Halfway through, you’ll be treated to a surf and turf dinner of lobster and steak. But don’t be fooled - everything’s not quite as it seems. Soon after, another pirate ship will steal quietly up to stage a wicked attack. The two bands of pirates will battle it out in a spectacular show, performing realistic swordfights on deck. It’s spine-tingling stuff. Then, once the fight’s over, everyone will enjoy a party atmosphere and more drinks as you sail back to port."

One of Mexico’s biggest holiday attractions, it’s an all-singing, all-dancing eco-archaeological park that’s great for grown-ups and kids. Laze on the white sand beach, bathe in the jungle lagoons or spy on jaguars, monkeys and bats. Grab a snorkel to waft along the underwater river. Or take the plunge and try Snuba - a weird and wonderful cross between snorkelling and scuba. The kids will also want to visit the aviary and watch the sea turtles. When you get peckish, you can take your pick from five Mexican and international restaurants. Stay around for the nightly show, too. Cue ancient Mayan rituals, rodeo displays and amazing stunts played out on a torchlit outdoor stage. With this trip, you’ll need your own transport but you can arrive and leave when you want. Be aware that some of Xcaret’s attractions have an extra charge."

And nowadays, it’s the only Mayan archaeological site to still be half-cocooned in jungle, so it’s particularly atmospheric. Let your guide show you the haunting ruins, which include temples, pillars and a ballcourt. The star turn though is Nohoch Mul pyramid, the tallest in the Yucatán at 42 metres high. If you’re energetic enough, climb the 120 steps to the top - the views are breathtaking. After your guided explorations are done, you’ll have time to roam around independently before heading for a restaurant for a traditional Mexican lunch. Afterwards, it’s off to a thatched Mayan village where you’ll meet some Mayan people and learn more about their mystical, age-old culture. You’ll round off the day at a ‘cenote’ sinkhole - swimming, snorkelling or just relaxing at one of these beautiful flooded caverns."
